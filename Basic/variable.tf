#Create Your First Variable
variable "instance_type" {
  default = "t2.micro"
}

#Use the Variable in a Resource
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0866a3c8686eaeeba"  # Example AMI ID
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}

#Change the Variable Value in Different Ways
/* Create a file in your project folder called terraform.tfvars.
Inside this file, add the variable and set its value. For example: 

instance_type = "t3.micro"

Now, whenever you run terraform apply, Terraform will automatically pick up the value from terraform.tfvars.
This is the easiest way to change variable values in one place without touching the main code. */
